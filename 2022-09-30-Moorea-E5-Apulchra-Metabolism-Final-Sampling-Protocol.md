# Overivew  

This protocol details the process for conducting fainl sampling for the E5 *A. pulchra* metabolism project in Mo'orea in Dec 2022. Proceedures for collecting and sampling biopsies are modified from D. Becker-Polinski same day processing protocol for *A. pulchra* which can be [found here](https://github.com/daniellembecker/Gametogenesis/blob/main/protocols/2021-12-26-Sample_Same_Day_Processing_Protocol.md).   

This protocol is modified from the E5 *A. pulchra* metabolism baseline protocol which can be [found here](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2022-09-30-Moorea-E5-Apulchra-Metabolism-Baseline-Sampling-Protocol.md). 

This protocol details sampling of all fragments per genotype for CBASS thermal tolerance, live respirometry, RNA and DNA, epigenetics (methylation and chromatin structure), metabolomics, and physiology (e.g., symbiont density, biomass).  

The purpose of final sampling is to characterize how shifts in metabolism due to light and feeding treatments impacts stress response and epigenetic state.  

The response metrics are as follows:  

- Thermal tolerance via CBASS
- Photosynthesis and respiration rates 
- DNA for 16S and ITS2 microbial and symbiont communities
- Metabolomics
- Chromatin structure  
- Gene expression  
- Protin
- Cell density 
- Chlorophyll content 

[A visual overview of the sampling can be found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MHMmUbBebRph_rY36YSlRjnJUeb1r8iSGKmIrau8cTA/edit#slide=id.g19538c05aa9_0_8).

# Datasheets required  

Open the following data sheets in preparation for sampling on your computer (requires cloning the repository onto your computer using Git in the command line):    

- [Fragment tracking and metadata](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/fragments.csv)
- [Final sampling checklist](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/final_sampling/final_sampling_checklist.xlsx)
- [Final sampling inventory list](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/final_sampling/final_sample.id.csv)

# Preparing tubes and whirlpacks    

Label whirlpacks with fragment number (n=186 whirlpacks) and project information. An exmaple is as follows:  

```
E5 Apul Metabolism
Dec 2022
Final
A7
Putnam 
```

*Note: Decide how we want to do chipping - if we do n=4 tubes per fragment we will have 4x186 tubes = 744*  

Label tubes in consective numbers on the top cap (#97-840). On the side of the tube, label with "E5 Metab. 2022" and the tube number again.  

Fill half of the tubes with 1 mL of RNA DNA shield each. The other half of the tubes will be used to freeze in liquid nitrogen. Record tube numbers on the [final sample inventory list](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/final_sampling/final_sample.id.csv).  

Label tube boxes with the following information:  

```
E5 A. pulchra Metabolism

Final 
Samples in RNA DNA Shield
Box #
```

```

# 1. Fragment photographs (Day 1)  

First, take a photograph of each fragment for reference of pigmentation and size using the following proceedure:  

- Remove fragments that need to be sampled of one genotype at a time to do all processing steps below before moving onto the next fragment. Place fragments in a small bin filled with seawater. Each time fragments are removed for processing, record the date sampled on the [fragment tracking and metadata sheet](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/fragments.csv).  
- Remove/clean algae from string and coral fragment.  
- Place the fragment at the bottom of a shallow bin on top of waterproof paper. Place a ruler with color standard (R, G, B) next to the fragment. Place the clip with fragment label in the frame of the photograph.
- Take a picture with your phone or a camera.   
- After all photographs are completed for the day, save the photos in the E5 [apulchra_metabolism GitHub repo in the folder here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/tree/main/data/final_sampling) with the date and frag ID in the photo file name.     
- Add "yes" to the photograph column in the [Final sampling checklist](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/final_sampling/final_sampling_checklist.xlsx) after taking a photo of each fragment. Ensure that all fragments have a photograph.  
- After all photographs are taken at the end of the day, rinse the bin with fresh water and store.  

Here is an example photograph:

# 2. CBASS Sampling (Day 1)   

Insert protocol and notes here.  

After sampling, flash freeze in labeled whirlpack.   

# 3. P and R - respirometry (Day 1)   

After sampling, flash freeze in labeled whirlpack.   

# 4. Sampling biopsies in the lab (Day 2)   

For each fragment process with the following proceedure:  

## Prepare supplies  

- Wear gloves during the entire processing process.  
- Add some liquid nitrogen to a small cooler. 
- Place a clean paper towel on the bench top. 
- Prepare the boxes, tubes, and whirlpack needed. For each fragment, look at the tube numbers identified on the [final sample inventory list](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/final_sampling/final_sample.id.csv).  
- There will be n=2 RNA DNA shield tubes and n=2 snap freeze tubes per fragment. There will be n=1 whirlpack per fragment.  
- Clean the bone cutters by first immersing in 10% bleach, then 70% ethanol.  

## Sampling   

- First, sample biopsies for the tubes that need to be snap frozen. These will be used for metabolomics and chromatin structure. 
- **It is critical to wear gloves and not allow contamination between samples. We are measuring sensitive metrics and contamination prevention is critical.**  
- Use the bone cutters to scrap a 5-10 polyp area off the base - mid branch of the fragment. Scrape this into the first snap freeze tube. Repeat this for the second tube.  
- Immediately freeze these two tubes in liquid nitrogen. 
- Next, use the bone cutters to scrap a 5-10 polyp area off the base of the fragment. Put into the first DNA RNA shield tube. Repeat this for the second tube.  
- Put the RNA DNA shield tubes into the respective box in the -40C freezer. 
- Remove the tubes from liquid nitrogen, put in the respective box and into the -40C freezer. 
- Take the remaining fragment and put into the whirlpack bag. Close securely and place in the -40C freezer. 
- Immerse the bone cutters in 10% bleach, 70% ethanol, and DI water between fragments. 
- Wipe gloves with an alcohol wipe. 
- Replace the paper towel. 
- Repeat this process for all fragments.  
- Check off the respective columns for each fragment on the [final sampling checklist](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/final_sampling/final_sampling_checklist.xlsx).  

# 3. Clean up and notebooks  

- Clean up all supplies and ensure all samples are in the freezer. 
- Update the [final sample inventory list](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/final_sampling/final_sample.id.csv) to include a location - box number and freezer - for all samples.  
- Ensure that the [fragment tracking and metadata](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/fragments.csv) and [final sampling checklist](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/baseline_sampling/final_sampling_checklist.xlsx) are completed.  
- Add a notebook entry to the [E5 notebook for this project](https://github.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2022-09-20-E5-Moorea-Adult-Stressor-Experiment.md).
