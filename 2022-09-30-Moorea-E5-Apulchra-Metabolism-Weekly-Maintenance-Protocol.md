# E5 A. pulchra metabolism project weekly maintenance

# Overivew  

Each week, there are several tasks that need to be completed to maintain the E5 *A. pulchra* metabolism experiment.  

See notebook posts for [more information about this project here](https://urol-e5.github.io/2022/09/20/E5-Moorea-Adult-Stressor-Experiment.html).  

This protocol outlines the tanks that should be completed each week. As you complete weekly maintenance, complete the [schedule weekly checklist here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/schedule.xlsx).  

Throughout this protocol ensure to write the proceedures used and any notes in a [notebook post entry here](https://github.com/urol-e5/urol-e5.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2022-09-20-E5-Moorea-Adult-Stressor-Experiment.md).  

# 1. Clean tanks

To clean tanks, carefully unclip and remove all fragments from tanks. Remove the pump from the tank and place in the water table (it can be kept running in the water table). Place the fragments in a water table with running water. Ensure that fragments from each tank stay grouped together and do not get mixed up.    

Dump the seawater out of the tanks into the water table. Then use fresh water and a microfiber towel to clean the tanks. Rinse with fresh water. 

# 2. Rearrange position of tanks 

Once all tanks have been cleaned, rearrange their position when you put them back into the table. This will allow all tanks to experience variation in light conditions that will occur in the water tables. Start water flow in the tanks and place pumps back in the tanks once full.   

# 3. Clean fragments  

While the tanks are being cleaned, remove any algae from the coral strings and tags and from the fragments.  

# 4. Survival assessments  

While cleaning the fragments, make note of any partial mortality or complete mortality in the [fragment tracking datasheet](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/fragments.csv). If the fragment has died, write the date in the `date.mortality` column. Note any partial mortality or other observations in the ntoes column with a date stamp. If a fragment has died, remove it from the tanks.  

# 5. Rearrange fragments within tanks  

Place the fragments back in their respective tanks, confirming the location of fragments using the tank assignment in the [fragment tracking datasheet](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/data/fragments.csv). As you put them back, this will randomize their position in the tank.  

# 6. Download Hobo pendant loggers  

Each week or every other week, download the Hobo Pendant loggers for each tank. Rename the files with SSN_YYYYMMDD_Tank and add to the [logger files folder in GitHub](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/tree/main/data/environmental/loggers). Keep the loggers logging and place back in the middle of tanks. Make a note in a notebook post on the time cleaning was conducted so this data can be removed from the logger data.
