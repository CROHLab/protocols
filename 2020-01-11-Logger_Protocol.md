### Data Download
Following the logger [manual](https://www.onsetcomp.com/files/manual_pdfs/16844-G%20U24-002-C%20Manual.pdf):  
1. Connect the U24 coupler to the base station, and connect the USB cable fron the base station to the laptop.  
2. Align the arrows on the coupler and sensor, and push the sensor into the coupler following the image below.

3. Start HOBOware on the laptop.  
4. Read out the logger data by clicking the "Readout Device" icon.     
5. Verify the status of the logger and launch as necessary.

### Calibration
Conductivity Solution
RICCA Cat# 2248 Conductivity Standard 50,000 µS/cm at 25°C

Measure a known conductivity standard in the lab at 25°C before deployment and after the return of the logger before cleaning. Protocols following the logger [manual](https://www.onsetcomp.com/files/manual_pdfs/16844-G%20U24-002-C%20Manual.pdf).

Following Method #3: Taking a sample back to the office in a sealable jar to measure there (recommended for locations with conductivity that is stable when you do not have a field meter or it is not convenient to access the logger):
1. Place a sample of the water taken from next to the logger in a jar and immediately seal it to ensure that none of the water evaporates. This allows the specific conductance and salinity of the sample to be maintained, which in turn results in usable temperature and conductivity readings when you measure it with the meter at a later time.
2. Write down the time you take the sample for use later in the HOBOware Conductivity Assistant.
3. At the office, measure the temperature and actual conductivity of the sample with a meter and write down the values next to the time you noted in step 2.

If not water sample was taken, the protocol can be done with a known conductivity standard.
1. Place all conductivity loggers, a temperature probe, and a discrete conductivity probe in a known conductivity standard (50,000 µS/cm at 25°C).  
2. Heat or cool down the solution to 25°C.  
3. Take a discrete conductivity reading at the same time the loggers are scheduled to take a measurement. Take note of the time, temperature, logger conductivity readings, and the discrete conductivity measurement.  

### Deployment

Following the deployment protocol in the logger [manual](https://www.onsetcomp.com/files/manual_pdfs/16844-G%20U24-002-C%20Manual.pdf):  
1. Launch the logger with a laptop or shuttle. *More details added here soon.*
2. Take a calibration reading as described above.  
3. Remove white electrical and copper tape that has fouled over the sampling time period. Re-tape with new electrical and copper tape prior to re-deployment.  
4. Clean the conductivity sensor as necessary (not with sharp objects).   
5. See field image below as an example for deployment.

# <a name="pH"></a> **HOBO MX pH Logger**

Following the protocols in the HOBO MX pH logger [manual](https://www.onsetcomp.com/files/manual_pdfs/22511-M%20MX2501%20Manual.pdf).
### Data Download
1. Download the HOBOmobile app from the App Store® or Google Play™. Open the app and enable bluetooth in device settings.  
2. Wake up the logger by pushing the switch on the mounting end of the logger into the gap beneath the mounting lanyard.  
3. Tape the Devices icon and then tap Loggers at the top of the screen. Tape the logger in the list to connect to it. See image below.
