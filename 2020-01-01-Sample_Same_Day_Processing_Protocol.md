    -     Molucular sample processing
        -     Move molecular samples from dry shipper into -40C freezer (Biocode). Make sure they are organized for long-term storage.
    -  Physiological sample processing
        -  Take physiological samples in their bags to the water table and float them.
        -  Get waterproof paper and zipties to make labels for each coral sample.
        -  Cut out labels with appropriate coral ID, leaving enough space to insert a ziptie (approx 1 inch).
        -  Cut 2 small, parallel lines in the tag through which to run a ziptie.
        -  Ziptie each label onto its corresponding coral loosely.
        -  Make a labelled map on waterproof paper to sit at the bottom of the water table. Place each coral sample over its allocated spot as a means of secondary identification.
        -  Take a photo of the corals on their maps in the water table.
    -  *Turbinaria* sample processing
        -  Take bags of *Turbinaria* to water table and empty out bag.
        -  For each "frond" remove one "cup" that is at least 2-3 cm (~1 inch) from the top, but make sure it is also not the bottom of the "frond".
        -  Using a toothbrush, scrub off all epiphytes. You may have to use fingernails to get into crevices and clean it fully. A clean "cup" should be yellowish brown with reddish spots. 
        -  Clean one "cup" from each of 100 "fronds" for a total of 100 "cups".
        -  Once you have 100 cleaned "cups", make 10 tinfoil pouches. To make a tinfoil pouch:
            -  Cut a piece of tinfoil (approx 6 x 12 inches).
            -  Fold it in half.
            -  Fold each side over twice. This should leave an envelope pouch with an opening at the top (approx 6 x 4 inches).
        -  Place 10 "cups" into each tinfoil pouch. Leave the top open for drying.
        -  Turn on drying oven by holding the power button. For detailed user information of the drying oven see [https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LED/manuals/D01709~.pdf](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LED/manuals/D01709~.pdf)
        -  Place the pouches upright in the drying oven (LTER lab). These pouches should slide neatly into the grating of the drying oven to hold them upright.
        -  The drying oven should be set to 80C.
