1. <a name="Materials"></a> **Materials**
    - 	Stainless Steel Bone cutters
    - 	Whirlpaks
    -  Liquid nitrogen or dry shipper
    -  Underwater camera and color standard
   

2. <a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**
	1. Prelabel three replicate whirlpaks for each colony to be sampled with date, species code, tag ID and site. 
	2. Photograph coral with tag and color standard visible
	2. Clip biopsy of ~4x4x4 cm and place in whirl pack with water and seal whirlpak (this is the 'physiology' sample).  
		• For *Acropora*, this should be a branch with an apical polyp
	3. Clip biopsy of ~3x3x3 cm and place in whirl pack with water and seal whirlpak (this is the 'molecular' sample).   
		• For *Acropora*, this should be **not** be apical polyp
	4. Clip biopsy of ~1x1x1 cm and place in whirl pack with water and seal whirlpak (this is the 'backup molecular' sample).   
		• For *Acropora*, this should be **not** be apical polyp
	5. Return whirlpaks to boat and drain all water.
	6. Place molecular samples in liquid nitrogen or dry shipper to snap freeze.
	7. Return to lab and place in -40°C freezer

	Repeat this for replicate samples as needed
