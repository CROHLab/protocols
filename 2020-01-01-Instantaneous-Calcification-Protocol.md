# Instantaneous Calcification Protocol

Original: 20200105   
Last Revised: 20200105

Protocol for measuring instantaneous calficiation immediately following the [PI Curve Protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-PI-Curve-Protocol.md).

    - 	Coral (PI curve already measured)
    -  2 Respirometry stands (with 4 screw-on legs)
	- Chambers x12
	- Magnetic stir bars x12
	- Chamber screw key
	- 2 large bins (to hold chambers)
	- Extra bin (for source water to fill chambers)
	- Powersonic 6 Volt, 3.5 Amp rechargeable battery
	- Powersonic Battery charger with cable
	- Bug net (if need to lower PAR values)
	- Ocean Revive lights
	- Strap wrench
	- Parafilm
	- Pipet tips (p20uL and p200uL)
	- Heater(s)
	- Pumps
	- Bags suitable for snap freezing the coral
	- Dry shipper with liquid nitrogen
	- Brown bottles (for each run: 2 initials + 1 per coral + 1 blank)
	- 150mL opaque collection bottle

    - 	Fill the extra bin for the source water at least 3/4 of the way full.
    -  Once flow is stopped and the water source is finalized, measure the temperature, pH, and salinity of the water. 
    -  Take 2 initial samples of the water source using the brown bottles. To take a total alkalinity sample:
	    -  Rinse the bottle three times by partially filling it, and dumping the rinse outside of the source water
	    -  After triple rinsing, completely fill the bottle so that there is no airspace
	    -  Cap and secure and the water sample with the bottle fully submerged, making sure there are no bubbles in the cap
	    -  Add 75uL of saturated mercuric chloride to each initial sample bottle as soon as possible. A small amount may need to be poured out of the bottle before poisoning. This will poison any living microorganisms that may impact the sample. Invert bottle multiple times to mix. **Make sure to perform this in the fume hood, wear appropriate PPE, and dispose of all hazardous waste appropriately)**.
    -  Parafilm at least twelve 200uL tips and twelve 20uL tips. When parafilming, cover the end of the tip so that it is air and water tight. Add extra parafilm around where the top grooved section meets the smooth portion of the tip. A good amount of parafilm is necessary to form a tight seal of the chamber probe holes.
    -  When the [PI Curve Protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-PI-Curve-Protocol.md) is finished and volume is recorded, immediately take empty coral to the extra bin to fill with source water, ensuring coral is dry for as little time as possible.
    -  When chamber is full and is free of bubbles, plug the probe holes with parafilmed pipet tips (200uL for temperature probe hole and 20uL for oxygen probe hole).
    -  Record the Start Time for each chamber, as soon as it is plugged.
    - Once the start time is recorded, bring the chambers to the respiration setup and set them in their allocated positions. 
    - Once all chambers are plugged and placed in the respiration setup, set the light levels to ~500 PAR (using Ocean Revive lights this is 65% for both Ch 1 and Ch 2). 
    - Leave the chambers for 1 hr (this was done on 20200104).
    	-On 20200105 we tested 1.5 hours and the signals between 1 hour and 1.5 hours were compared. Since the 1.5 hours signal was much higher we will be running samples from here on out for 1.5 hours
    - Take temperature readings every 10 minutes. 
    - After corals sit for an hour, remove one chamber at a time, recording the End Time when the plugs are removed
    - Unscrew the top cap plug and pour ~50 mL of water into a 150mL opaque collection bottle. Measure and record the temperature, salinity, and pH of this water.
    - Collect the remaining water in its corresponding brown bottle (should be labeled to corresponding coral ID) using the same methods for the initial sample (i.e., triple rinses and filling to minimize air bubbles).
    	-For this trip we had only one brown bottle per chamber/coral sample. For next trip and future we want water samples in duplicate because there was some variability.
    - Once the chamber is emptied of water, transfer the coral into a prelabeled ziploc or whirl-pak bag and snap freeze in the dry shipper containing liquid nitrogen.
    - Poisoin all brown bottle samples using 75uL of saturated mercuric chloride. Invert the bottles to mix. **Make sure to perform this in the fume hood, wear appropriate PPE, and dispose of all hazardous waste appropriately)**.
