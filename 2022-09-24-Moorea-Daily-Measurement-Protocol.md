# Overivew  

This protocol details the steps to feed corals in tanks for the 2022 Moorea *A. pulchra* metabolism experiment.   Feeding for this experiment will take place three times per week (Mon, Wed, Fri).  

# Materials Required  

- Coral max food (n=4 doses of 1 mL of coral max food; approx. 0.5 g per dose)  
- Plastic transfer pipette  
- Timer or cell phone timer 
- Scoopula/spatula   
- Tripour or nalgene beaker  

# Datasheets Required  

Record the time of feeding on the [schedule datasheet here](https://github.com/urol-e5/apulchra_metabolism/blob/main/schedule.xlsx). Add any notes regarding feeding to the notes column.   

# 1. Prepare food dosage  

- Prepare dosages of Coral Max food for each tank in this experiment: Tanks 1, 3, 4, and 5. 
- Each tank's dose can be added to the labeled 5 mL tubes for each tank.  
- Using the scoopula/spatula, add food up to the 1 mL black line in each 5 mL tube. This will be approx. 0.5 g of food per tank.

# 2. Shut off water  

- Turn off water on the main line to all tanks.  
- Record the time the water was shut off.  
- Use a tri pour or nalgene beaker to remove 1-2 L of water to ensure the food does not drain out of the tank during feeding. 
- Allow the tanks to finish draining any water out of the drain holes. 

  
4. Add the food to each respective tank (tanks 1, 3, 4, 5) and stir and break up the chunks with a transfer pipette.  
5. Start a timer for 1 h. 
6. After 1 h, turn the water flow back on.  

# 3. Add food to tanks   

- Add the food to each respective tank from the labeled 5 mL tubes with food doses.  
- Pour the food in the tank. 
- Use the transfer pipette to stir the food into the water and break up any chunks of food.  
- Rinse the 5 mL tubes with water and dry to prepare for the next feeding.  

# 4. Turn on water    

- After 1 hour, turn the water back on to the tanks and make sure all tanks have flow.  
- Repeat 3 times per week.
